Interaction pair potentials for the manuscript:

"Non-Close-Packed Three-Dimensional Quasicrystals"
Pablo F. Damasceno, Sharon C. Glotzer, Michael Engel

Each file ('potential.n.dat' with n = 1,...,10) contains:
* column 1: separation distance r
* column 2: interaction energy
* column 3: interaction force (scalar)

The potentials are cut off at r = 2.94.
They can be used with any molecular dyanmics simulation code.
